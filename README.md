# Movie-Database

This database was created for Information Studies 327, Database Design and Modeling, as a group project.
My group and I chose to make a database that used movies made after 2000 and had large budgets.

We started by creating the ERD diagram and had multiple revisions during this project.
Our database features 9 individual tables and makes use of one-to-many relationships.

I contributed by sorting and inserting the data. I also worked with a group member to insert the views and to assign the necessary fields primary and foreign keys. By doing this I learned how to forward engineer a database and ensure the integrity of it. 
I also learned how to create a database that adheres to professional guidelines by following 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Normal Forms.

The files included in this repository are the submission files for the project.

0203_Team_5_Dump File
This file contains the structure of the database as well as sample views that another group member made. 
These views are scripts that can be run that highlight different types of queries than can utilize the database.

0203_Team_5_ERD
The entity-relationship-diagram for this database shows how the group set up the relationships. 
It also includes that names of the tables as well as the names of the fields in them.
The ERD uses symbols on the left of the field names to denote foreign keys and primary keys.

0203_Team_5_Final
This file contains the structure of the database, the views, and scripts to populate the tables with data.
Forward engineering this file to a local instance of MYSQL Workbench would allow the user to have the fully populated database and sample scripts.

0203_Team_5_View_Script
This file contains the sample views created to showcase different functions of our database.

Final Project Submission - INST327
Two other members of the group created a written report of the project. 
They included the ERD, information on what the sample views can do, our thought process on the design, and struggles we encountered when doing this project.
